# Task 1

* Get the current working directory

```{r}
getwd()
```

# Task 2

* Read in the SPRUCE.csv file and print the first six lines

```{r}
spruce = read.csv("SPRUCE.csv")
head(spruce)
```

# Task 3

* Make a scatter plot of the SPRUCE data (y axis will be the Height).  
  * Make sure it has a heading  
  * Y axis is labelled  
  * X axis is labelled  
  * Points are filled blue, use pch=21 and bg="Blue"  
  * The points are 1.2Xs the default character size (use cex=1.2)  
  * The y and x axes are adjusted to include 0 and 1.1 * max(y), and 0 and 1.1 * max(x) respectively  
  
```{r}
plot(Height~BHDiameter, bg = "Blue", pch = 21, cex = 1.2, ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1), xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) * 1.1), main = "Tree Height vs Breast Height Diameter", xlab = "Height of Tree (m)", ylab = "Breast Height Diameter", data = spruce)
```

* Does there appear to be a straight line relationship?  

There does not appear to be a straight line relationship. If you analyze the scatter plot very closely, you can see the points increase and then begin to plateau when BHDiameter is between 15 and 25.  

* Load the library s20x and make a lowess smoother scatter plot using trendscatter() (try a few values of f, f=0.5,0.6,0.7) record all three plots, use layout().

```{r}
layout = layout(matrix(1:3, nrow = 1, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))
tsone = trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, f = 0.5, data = spruce)
tstwo = trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, f = 0.6, data = spruce)
tsthree = trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter, f = 0.7, data = spruce)
```

* We will assume (this may in fact be a bad assumption) a straight line relationship, use lm and make a linear model object, call it spruce.lm  

```{r}
spruce.lm = with(spruce, lm(Height~BHDiameter))
```

* Make a new scatter plot and add the least squares regression line to the points -abline(spruce.lm) – record the plot.  

```{r}
layout = layout(1)

plot(Height~BHDiameter, bg = "Blue", pch = 21, cex = 1.2, ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1), xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) * 1.1), main = "Tree Height vs Breast Height Diameter", xlab = "Height of Tree (m)", ylab = "Breast Height Diameter", data = spruce)

abline(spruce.lm)
```

* Comment on the graph, is a straight line appropriate? Consider the smoother curve also.  

A straight line definitely works - the scatterplot does not have such a drastic curve that the line looks wrong. However, it is easy to tell that our straight line is not as accurate as possible and a curved line would be more suitable for our data. This point is backed up by the fact that we created three trendscatter plots, and all three of them had a clear curve in them near the top.  

# Task 4

* Divide the graphical interface into 4 equal areas, use layout.show(4) and record the picture  
  * In the first square, plot the scatter plot and fitted line.  
  * In the second square plot the same with the residual line segments (deviations about the fitted line).     (RSS=residual sum of squares)  
  * In the third square plot the mean of Y versus X i.e. mean of Height vs BHDiameter, with the fitted        line and deviations of the fitted line from the mean height added. (MSS=model sum of squares)  
  * In the fourth square plot the mean of Height versus BHDiameter and show the total deviation line          segments y ̂=y ̅. (TSS=total sum of squares)  
  
```{r}
layout(matrix(1:4,nr=2,nc=2,byrow=TRUE))

# Plot 1
plot(Height~BHDiameter, bg = "Blue", pch = 21, cex = 1.2, ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1), xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) * 1.1), xlab = "Height", ylab = "BHDiameter", data = spruce)
abline(spruce.lm)

# Plot 2
plot(Height~BHDiameter, bg = "Blue", pch = 21, cex = 1.2, ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1), xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) * 1.1), xlab = "Height", ylab = "BHDiameter", data = spruce)

#make yhat the estimates of E[HEAT | RATIO]
yhat=with(spruce,predict(spruce.lm,data.frame(BHDiameter)))
#OR you could use -- (yhat values the predicted values for all the RATIO values )
yhat=fitted(spruce.lm)

# Draw in segments making the residuals (regression deviations)
with(spruce,{
segments(BHDiameter,Height,BHDiameter,yhat)
})
abline(spruce.lm)

# Plot 3
plot(Height~BHDiameter, bg = "Blue", pch = 21, cex = 1.2, ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1), xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) * 1.1), xlab = "Height", ylab = "BHDiameter", data = spruce)

#make nieve model
with(spruce, abline(h=mean(Height)))
abline(spruce.lm)

#make the explained deviations (explained by the model)
with(spruce, segments(BHDiameter,mean(Height),BHDiameter,yhat,col="Red"))

# Plot 4
with(spruce,
plot(Height~BHDiameter, bg = "Blue", pch = 21, cex = 1.2, ylim = c(0, max(Height) * 1.1), xlim = c(0, max(BHDiameter) * 1.1), xlab = "Height", ylab = "BHDiameter", data = spruce))

with(spruce,abline(h=mean(Height)))
with(spruce, segments(BHDiameter,Height,BHDiameter,mean(Height),col="Green"))
```


* Calculate TSS, MSS, and RSS  

```{r}
TSS=with(spruce,sum((Height-mean(Height))^2))
MSS=with(spruce,sum((yhat-mean(Height))^2))
RSS=with(spruce,sum((Height-yhat)^2))

cat("TSS = ", TSS, "\n")
cat("MSS = ", MSS, "\n")
cat("RSS = ", RSS, "\n")
```

* Calculate $\frac{MSS}{TSS}$, and interpret it!  

```{r}
DividedValue <- MSS / TSS
DividedValue
```
$\frac{MSS}{TSS}$ is a measure that assesses the ability of a model to predict or explain an outcome when using linear regression. Also known as $R^2$, a high value indicates that the model is a good fit for the data. If we round the value we got, we can see that 0.66, or 66%, of the variability of the dependent variable in the data set has been accounted for, and the other 34% is still unaccounted for.  

* Does TSS = MSS + RSS?

```{r}
TSS
MSS + RSS
```

We can see that TSS does equal MSS + RSS  

# Task 5

* Summarize spruce.lm and paste it here

```{r}
summary(spruce.lm)
```

* What is the value of the slope?  

The slope value is 0.48147  

* What is the value of the intercept?  

The value of the intercept is about 9.14684  

* Write down the equation of the fitted line  

$Y = 0.48 + 9.15 * X$, where $Y = Height$ and $X = BHDiameter$  

* Predict the Height of spruce when the Diameter is 15, 18, and 20cm (use predict())  

```{r}
testdata <- data.frame(BHDiameter = 15)
predict(spruce.lm, newdata = testdata)

testdata <- data.frame(BHDiameter = 18)
predict(spruce.lm, newdata = testdata)

testdata <- data.frame(BHDiameter = 20)
predict(spruce.lm, newdata = testdata)
```

# Task 6

* Use appropriate code using the ggplot2 package to make a plot of Height Vs Diameter with shading lines and legend

```{r}
g=ggplot(spruce, aes(x=BHDiameter,y=Height,color=BHDiameter))
g=g+geom_point() + geom_line()+ geom_smooth(method="lm")
g+ggtitle("Height Vs BHDiameter")
```
